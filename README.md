## Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

As a Research Scientist at Rain AI, I develop cutting-edge AI hardware solutions that integrate advanced hardware-software co-design strategies. I hold a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, a Masterâ€™s in Computer Architecture, and a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Hardware Engineering, with 11 years of diverse technical experience in AI research and development. My core competencies include efficient digital hardware design, Hypothesis Transfer Learning, Federated Learning, and Domain Adaptation, enabling me to tackle complex and heterogeneous AI challenges. I have authored several academic publications and hold patents in Artificial Intelligence and Digital Hardware Design. I occasionally serve as a reviewer at prestigious AI conferences and have created and published open-source projects, such as a simulation framework for Federated Learning.
